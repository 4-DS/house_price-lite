Prerequisites

- Sinara is successfully deployed as described in [SinaraML Tutorial](https://github.com/4-DS/sinara-tutorials/wiki/Getting-started-with-SinaraML)

# Step repository naming conventions

We will recommend forming the git repo name as: <%pipeline_name>-<%step_name>

But this is not a mandatory requirement. And our library should work under any layouts with naming

The authoritative source of the pipeline and step names will now be exclusively in configs, and will not be tightly tied to the names of folders and git repositories
